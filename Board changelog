- Finally had time to get back to work on this project


12/1/2024
- Edited board shape to integrate battery into center, to reduce thickness significantly. Battery capacity went from 2000mAH to 400mAH : Current projected battery life with normal usage is ~4 days. (full load being ~8.4 hours)
  (this was calculated with rough and pessimistic values so true battery life can easily be more (50mA at 3.3v, when battery provides between 4.2v and 3.2v - and once again, using excessive power consumption values)
- Replaced BN180 and HC05 modules with MAX-M10S and DA14531 respectivley, saving space and providing more accurate measurments as well as far lower theoretical power consumption.
  -> Both chips now use external antennas, connected via a UFL connector, allowing for a metal case without concerns of signal blocking.

-MAX-M10S functions on the same interface as the BN180 (UART0)
-DA14531 uses the UART1 interface, and is connected in such a manner that the RP2040 is able to program the chip over UART.

-Exposed debugging interfaces of RP2040 and DA14531 via pads in case they are needed in developpement.

12/3/24
-Had time again to progress on the design
-Replaced a few 0603 capacitors and some pull-ups with 0402 for space saving reasons
-Situatied BMS circuit under usb-connector, charge circuit on opposing side of board
